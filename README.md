# SillyPrototype

This repo contains an early prototype for experimenting with interactive storytelling mechanics.

## Setup

The `silly-lab` directory is a React project created with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Playing the game

A prebuilt version of the app is committed to this repository. Simply open
`index.html` in your browser and the grid simulator will load.

## Development

If you want to modify the code, the usual Vite workflow is still available:

```bash
cd silly-lab
npm install
npm run dev
```

After making changes run `npm run build` from the `silly-lab` directory. Copy the
contents of `silly-lab/dist` to the repository root (or run the build script in
this repository) so `index.html` and the `assets` folder are updated.
